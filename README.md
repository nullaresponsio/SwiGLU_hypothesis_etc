**Upsides of Mixing Vision with Text Generation**

* **Richer Contextual Understanding**
  Incorporating images lets the model ground its text outputs in visual evidence—useful for tasks like visual question answering, captioning, or multimodal dialogue.
* **Improved Task Performance**
  Many real-world applications (e.g. assistive technologies, image-based search, medical report generation) demand jointly reasoning over visual and textual data; a unified model can outperform separate vision-only or language-only systems.
* **Emergent Multimodal Reasoning**
  When trained end-to-end, models often learn cross-modal patterns (e.g. object-attribute mappings, spatial relations) that purely text-based LMs never see.
* **Parameter-Efficient Adaptation**
  Techniques like LoRA or adapters can be plugged into a language model backbone to absorb vision features without retraining the entire network from scratch.
* **More Natural Interaction**
  Chatbots or assistants that “see” alongside “speak” feel more intuitive—users can point at an image or diagram and get targeted explanations.

**Downsides of Mixing Vision with Text Generation**

* **Increased Model Complexity**
  You now need a vision encoder (e.g. ViT), cross-attention layers, positional/visual alignment modules—and all their hyperparameters—to get right.
* **Higher Computational & Memory Costs**
  Processing images (especially high-res) and attending over combined visual + textual tokens greatly increases FLOPs, VRAM usage, and inference latency.
* **Data Requirements & Alignment**
  Effective training demands large, well-aligned image-text corpora. Curating and cleaning such multimodal datasets is far more involved than harvesting text alone.
* **Risk of Compounded Biases**
  Visual datasets carry their own stereotypes (e.g. gender, cultural biases in image collections), which can interact unpredictably with language biases, making debiasing harder.
* **Training Instability**
  Joint objectives (e.g. next-token loss + vision/text alignment losses + any safety or classification heads) can compete, requiring delicate weighting and scheduler tuning.
* **Debugging & Interpretability Challenges**
  Tracing an error—did the model misinterpret the image, the text prompt, or the fusion step?—is much more complex than in single-modal systems.
* **Robustness & Adversarial Vulnerabilities**
  Vision models introduce new attack surfaces (e.g. adversarial patches or perturbed images) that can derail text outputs in unexpected ways.

In summary, **multimodal** systems unlock powerful new capabilities by fusing vision and language, but they demand **careful engineering**—from data curation through training and deployment—to manage the extra complexity, cost, and new sources of bias or failure.
